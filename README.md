# 📕 About

This project is a modern job opportunities API built using Golang, currently one of the highest paying programming languages. The API is powered by Go-Gin as a router, GoORM for database communication, SQLite as the database, and Swagger for API documentation and testing. The project follows a modern package structure to keep the codebase organized and maintainable.
